Q) What are some use cases for document stores?

- Semi-structured or unstructured data
- Content Management Systems - blog posts, news articles, of varying length, with different attributes, different numbers of images, etc
- Product Catalogs - wide range of products with varying attributes
- Data generated by IoT devices
- Multilingual Content storage - different language versions of a document will be stored with a different ID, rather than as different attributes in a relational table

Q) Why use couchbase?

- If you cannot tabulate your data - i.e can't use relational database

Q) What is N1QL and how does Couchbase use it?

A) N1QL (pronounced "nickel") is Couchbase's query language, which is similar in syntax and function to SQL but designed for JSON data. N1QL allows you to query, transform, and manipulate JSON documents in Couchbase. It provides the power and familiarity of SQL with the flexibility of JSON, enabling complex queries, joins, and aggregation operations on document-based data.

Q) What makes Couchbase an 'easy to scale' server? What database types are hard to scale?

- NoSQL databases are easier to scale than SQL databases

Q) What is a Document Store?

A document store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data as documents, typically in formats like JSON, BSON, or XML. These databases are schema-less, meaning that each document can have a unique structure. Document stores are ideal for managing semi-structured data and are known for their flexibility, scalability, and ease of use for developers, especially when dealing with complex data models or rapidly changing data structures. Couchbase is an example of a document store database

Q) Where does Couchbase fall on the CAP model?

Q) WHy are NoSQL databases better at horizontal scaling?

- NoSQL databases are typically designed with horizontal scaling in mind, whereas SQL databases were designed with vertical scaling in mind
- Partly this is due to the transactional consistency requirements
